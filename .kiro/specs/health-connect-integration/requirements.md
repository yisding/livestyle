# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Google Health Connect data on Android to provide users with comprehensive health tracking capabilities. The integration will allow the LiveStyle app to read and write health data including weight, body composition, workout sessions, heart rate, and other fitness metrics from the centralized Health Connect platform. This will enable users to have a unified view of their health data across multiple apps and devices while providing the LiveStyle AI coaches with richer data for personalized recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Health Connect data to LiveStyle, so that my health metrics are automatically synchronized and I don't need to manually enter data.

3. WHEN the user denies Health Connect permissions THEN the system SHALL allow manual data entry as a fallback
4. WHEN Health Connect is not available on the device THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to manual data entry
5. IF the user has previously denied permissions THEN the system SHALL provide a way to re-request permissions through settings

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN weight data is synced THEN the system SHALL update the user's progress charts and AI coach recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workout data to be automatically imported from Health Connect, so that all my exercise activities are tracked regardless of which app I used to record them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN workout data is imported THEN the system SHALL update workout history and progress tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Health Connect data to be stored separately from my manually entered data, so that I can distinguish between different data sources and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN calculating trends and analytics THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose which data source to prioritize
5. IF the user wants to override Health Connect data THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry without affecting the synced data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my Health Connect permissions and data sync preferences, so that I have control over what data is shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the user disables certain data types THEN the system SHALL stop syncing those specific data types
4. WHEN the user enables sync for a data type THEN the system SHALL immediately attempt to sync historical data
5. IF sync fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 6

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Health Connect is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached Health Connect data and manual entries
